2015.2.1:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 9)
 * No changes

2015.2:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 9)
 * Addition of MEX wrapper

2015.1:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 8)
 * C model updated to increase maximum Frequency Resolution from 10kHz to 125MHz.
 * Performance improved for cases above SFDR of 120dB or output width 20bits.
 * C model bugfix for situation where accumulator width could differ by 1 bit from that used by the IP core.
 * Addition of Beta support for future devices
 * Additional parameter checking added to C model
 * Supported devices and production status are now determined automatically, to simplify support for future devices
 * GUI behaviour changed so that Phase_Out appears by default when both phase_generator and sin_cos lut are selected
 * GUI changed to add explicit error message for out-of-range System clock.
 * C models are no longer provided for 32-bit operating systems as Vivado has deprecated 32-bit OS support

2014.4.1:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 7)
 * No changes

2014.4:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 7)
 * Encrypted source files are concatenated together to reduce the number of files and to reduce simulator compile time
 * Enabled out-of-context clock frequency setting by adding FREQ_HZ parameter to clock interface aclk_intf

2014.3:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 6)
 * DDS_Clock_Rate maximum value limit relaxed to 1000MHz. The actual maximum achievable will be determined by configuration and device.
 * C model smoke test run_bitacc_cmodel.c updated to correctly print negative values for sine and cosine when debug is enabled.  Also removed "using namespace std" line and replaced with "std::" where necessary.

2014.2:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 5)
 * DDS_Clock_Rate maximum value of 550MHz may restrict designs on new, fast devices. Setting Parameter Entry to Hardware_parameters can be used to work around the restriction.

2014.1:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 4)
 * sin_cos.vhd and sin_cos_quad_rast.vhd changed to work around simulation warnings. This change does not affect the behavior or performance of the core.
 * C models for Windows are compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes
 * Netlists created by write_verilog and write_vhdl are IEEE P1735 encrypted, with keys for supported simulators so that netlist simulation can still be done
 * Enable third party synthesis tools to read encrypted netlists (but not source HDL)
 * Support for Virtex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.4:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 3)
 * Fixed issue in GUI regarding illegal Phase_Angle_Values when Rasterized Mode_of_Operation was selected.
 * Missing GUI tooltips added.
 * GUI dependency between DSP48_Use and Latency corrected.
 * Support for Kintex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.3:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 2)
 * Cosmetic GUI changes to table header row, no change in functionality
 * Fixed issue where the behavior of 2-channel rasterized configurations produced incorrect outputs; see Xilinx Answer 56597.
 * Fixed issue of incorrect sign extension of M_AXIS_PHASE_TDATA for Rasterized configurations.
 * Behavioral VHDL model replaced by Encrypted RTL. For more information on this change please refer to the Migrating and Upgrading section in the Product Guide
 * Fixed issue of C model crash when calling reset function with configurations without a phase generator.
 * Internal standardization in source file delivery, does not change behavior
 * Support for Automotive Artix-7, Automotive Zynq, Defense Grade Artix-7, Defense Grade Zynq and Lower Power Artix-7 devices at Production Status
 * Added default constraints for out of context flow
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators
 * Removed C model dependency on stlport (STL Portability) library; C model now uses STL built into the compiler
 * Windows C model DLLs are statically linked to the Windows C run-time (CRT) library, to remove the runtime dependency on MSVCRT90.dll, which can cause problems when using the C model in a Windows compiler other than Visual Studio 2008

2013.2:
 * Version 6.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Support for Series 7 devices at Production status
 * Repackaged IP to remove internal debug ports from GUI symbol
 * Beta support for future devices

2013.1:
 * Version 6.0
 * Native Vivado Release
 * Added support for Zynq
 * Added C model
 * Added Rasterized Mode of Operation feature
 * Added Resync Feature
 * Added Output Form Feature
 * Fixed issue of AR42351. The TLAST signal in 2-channel configurations could initialize to the wrong value.
 * Fixed issue of AR40551. The first cycle following the de-assertion of ARESETn could previously be ignored.
 * Fixed issue where the S_AXIS_CONFIG channel could reach a lock-up state in certain mark-space patterns of ACLKEN.
 * Fixed issue of AR51915. The demonstration testbench could give syntax errors in certain configurations.
